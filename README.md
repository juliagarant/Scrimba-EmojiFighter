Challenge:
  When the user clicks on the "Pick Fighters" button, pick two random 
  emoji fighters and display them as i.e. "🦀 vs 🐢" in the "stage" <div>.

Built out the main functions in index.js using a base CSS and HTML template from Scrimba  
* Could have used fighters.length instead of counting the exact amount of items in the array.
  eg:     let random1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 17);
          let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * fighters.length);
