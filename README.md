Challenge:
  When the user clicks on the "Pick Fighters" button, pick two random 
  emoji fighters and display them as i.e. "🦀 vs 🐢" in the "stage" <div>.

  I didn't write the CSS or HTML. I wrote the inners of the function in index.js.
  * Could have used fighters.length instead of counting the exact amount of items in the array.
  eg:     let random1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 17);
          let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * fighters.length);
